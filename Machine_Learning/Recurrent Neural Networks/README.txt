LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory) are a special kind of recurrent neural network. Recurrent neural networks are very effective when processing sequential data. They take the output at a
certain time and feed it back into the architecture. This way, we can have a look back at themodel's previous behavior. We can take into account sequential and time based and
relationships unlike other types of neural networks. 

LSTMs are often used to accomplish problems dealing with things like forecasting (airline_pass.ipynb), text classification (bbc.ipybn and csv file), 
and sequence generation (nursery.ipybn, nursury_rhymes.txt).
