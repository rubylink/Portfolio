The folders contain code written in Java from my object oriented programming class. 

Spoons:
The Spoons code is a game simulation of the classic game Spoons. 

To play, each player tries to make four of a kind. The dealer takes a card from the deck to have five cards in their hand, removes one and passes to the next player.
The last player places their discard into a trash pile. Cards are picked up and passed until someone gets four of a kind and takes a spoon from the center. Once the 
player with four of a kind takes a spoon, anyone can take a spoon (each player in the code is assigned a probability of noticing a spoon is missing). The player left 
without a spoon loses. 

Music App:
The Music App code is simulting a music streaming service like Apple Music or Spotify. The main theme of the assignment is interfaces. You can interact with the songs by liking them, 
make playlists, and queue songs.
