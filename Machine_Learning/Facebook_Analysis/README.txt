The assignment was the final project for Intro to Data Science (CPSC 392). 

The data used in this project is from an anonymous organisationâ€™s social media ad campaign. 

Social Media Ad Campaign marketing is a leading source of Sales Conversion. In order to discover what factors contribute to highest rates of conversion in Facebook Advertisements, 
many models were implemented including linear regression, clustering algorithms, decision trees, and dimensionality reduction techniques. 

The Facebook Analysis pdf contains a list of all the variables in the dataset and the raw dataset can be accessed in the code. The list of questions that I set out to answer 
are  provided in the pdf. Answers to the questions are commented out in the ipbyn file..
