Using Iris data, I created a Python program to classify the dataset provided. (This is the classic iris dataset that has been altered to contain only 2 class 
labels for visual ease). A Support Vector Machine was implemented. 

The code and a formal write up are provided. The write up dicusses the dataset, methods used, and outcome of the models.
