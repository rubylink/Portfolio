In the files above, three Feed Forward Neural Networks are used for regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification. Two datasets are used: the churn dataset for 
regression and binary classification and the health dataset for multiclass classification. 

A formal write up is also attached dicussing the datasets, methods, and performance of the models.
