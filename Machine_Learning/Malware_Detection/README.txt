The dataset that used was taken from Kaggle but is originally from a GitHub repository. (https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter/blob/master/ReadMe.txt)
The data was scraped by CICFlowMeter which is a tool that generates Biflows from Packet Capture files, and extracts information from these flows.

In the code provided three feed forward neural networks, each an improvement upon the other, are implemented to predict the type and presence of malware in packets sent over a network. 

Code and a formal write-up are included.
