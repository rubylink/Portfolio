For this project, I am using a credit card attrition dataset from Kaggle. 

Credit card attrition, also known as customer churn, refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their relationship with a business or organization.
A predictive model for credit attrition can provide several benefits by allowing businesses to focus their resources on customers who are most likely to close their accounts and
helping businesses gain insights into the factors that contribute to attrition. 

The code provided above impmenents a Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest model in order to accuractly predict customer churn. 

The code and a formal write up are included. The write up discuess the dataset and results of each of the three models.
