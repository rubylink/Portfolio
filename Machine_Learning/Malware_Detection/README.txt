The dataset that used was taken from Kaggle but is originally from a GitHub repository. (https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter/blob/master/ReadMe.txt). The file is too large to upload directly to GitHub. 

The data was scraped by CICFlowMeter which is a tool that generates Biflows from Packet Capture files, and extracts information from these flows.

Three versions of a Feed Forward Neural Network are implemented in my code to predict the type and presence of malware in packets sent over a network. 

Code and a formal write-up are included. The write up includes discussion of the dataset, methods used, and results.
